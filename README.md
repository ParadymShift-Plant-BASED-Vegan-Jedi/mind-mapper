# mind-mapper
This mind mapper tool assists people to organize their thoughts, concepts, and projects into useful layered map-webs which go into infinity.

It works like this: 
Each mindmap has at least 1 bubble to start. From this "bubble", one can create multiple "bubbles" wherein strings and eventually images as well may be stored for future recall. Each bubble has the potenital to have more bubbles created from the bubble in question, creating up to infinite layers of information that can be accessed at any time by browsing through the mind map bubbles.
